This is my second project uploaded to GitHub.

At this point, there were several HTML/CSS tasks here. I learned basics of how to use HTML tags and what they do. Same situation with CSS selectors and stuff.

We'll see what happens next.

P.S. If you're interested in web-dev learning too, I stick to this site: From The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
